# vim-playpause

You are playing that awesome tune. Are totally focused on
what you are doing. A coworker arrives and asks you a question.
You want to pause that player. But you don't remember if it
was startet in iTunes or Spotify. Or don't want to fumble
with your mouse, app switcher or trackpad. What now?

**vim-playpause** to the rescue!

vim-playpause is a plugin for MacOS that tries to figure out if
iTunes or Spotify is currently playing and pauses it. You can
easyly resume playing after the coworker left.

Simply execute

    :PlayPause

and the plugin will try to pause the current track.

If you want to restart the player, just enter the command again.
